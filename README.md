# Custom React Hooks!
## useCopyToClipboard()
  This hook provides a simple way to copy content to the clipboard. It typically returns a function that, when invoked, copies a specified text to the clipboard.
## usePageBottom()
  The usePageBottom hook monitors the user's scroll position and triggers a callback when the bottom of the page is reached. This is useful for implementing infinite scrolling or loading more content as the user scrolls.
## useHttp()
  The useHttp hook is designed to simplify HTTP requests in React components. It may encapsulate the logic for making asynchronous requests to a server, handling loading states, and managing errors.
## useDeviceDetect()
  This hook provides information about the user's device, such as whether they are on a mobile device or desktop. It can be useful for conditionally rendering components or styles based on the user's device.
## useMediaQuery()
  The useMediaQuery hook allows you to conditionally render components based on a specified media query. It returns a boolean indicating whether the current screen matches the provided query.
## userFetch()
  The useFetch hook simplifies data fetching in React components. It handles the asynchronous nature of fetching data from an API and provides the fetched data, loading state, and potential errors.
## useClickOutside()
  This hook detects clicks outside a specified element. It's useful for scenarios where you want to close a dropdown, modal, or other UI element when the user clicks outside of it.
## useLocalStorage()
  The useLocalStorage hook syncs a state variable with the local storage, allowing for persistent storage of data between page reloads. It is helpful for managing simple client-side data storage.
## useGeolocation()
  The useGeolocation hook provides the user's current geolocation information, including latitude and longitude. It's useful for applications that require location-based functionality.
## useDebounce()
  The useDebounce hook delays the update of a value until a specified time has passed without further changes. This is helpful for scenarios like search input fields, where you want to avoid making requests on every keystroke.
## useOnScreen()
  This hook detects whether a specified element is currently in the user's viewport. It's often used for triggering animations or loading content when an element becomes visible.
## useIdle()
  The useIdle hook tracks whether the user is actively interacting with the application. It can be used to implement idle timeouts or trigger certain actions when the user becomes inactive.
## useDeviceOrientation()
  This hook provides information about the device's orientation, including tilt and rotation. It's useful for creating responsive layouts or interactive experiences based on device orientation.
## useKeyPress()
  A hook that tracks when a certain key or combination of keys is pressed.
## useAudioPlayer()
  This hook provides an interface for controlling audio playback, including features like play, pause, volume control, and track navigation.
## useThrottle()
  Similar to debounce, but instead of delaying the execution of a function, it limits the rate at which the function is called.
